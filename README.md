# Vault Master Curator

✨ A flexible, open-source toolkit to curate, index, and enrich personal or research knowledge vaults — from file chaos to crystal clarity.

---

## What is this?

**Vault Master Curator** helps you manage a large folder of knowledge files (Vault_Master_Data) by:

✅ Indexing files into a structured JSON manifest  
✅ Applying consistent tags (with YAML definitions)  
✅ Validating metadata against a clear schema  
✅ Enabling repeatable, transparent vault cleanups  
✅ Future-ready for AI-enhanced enrichment

---

## Features

- Automated metadata indexing
- Tag classification rules
- Configurable JSON schemas
- Easy to extend with new scripts
- Bash & Python hybrid tooling
- Open-source contributor friendly

---

## How it works

1. Place your unstructured files in `Vault_Master_Data`  
2. Run the ingest and indexing scripts  
3. Enrich or tag them using interactive tools  
4. Validate against the JSON schema  
5. Use the index for search, backup, or further AI enrichment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nz-gpts/vault-master-curator.git
